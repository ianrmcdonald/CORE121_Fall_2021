## Course Description

We expect democracies to translate public desire into coherent political choices. And we expect elections to deliver these results. But aggregating preferences with elections is harder than it looks. The simplest elections based on innocent design choices will produce paradoxical and confounding results.

In this course, weâ€™ll introduce mathematical and logical tools that can help us understand the paradoxes of elections. You will use these tools to develop and refine your quantitative reasoning skills and apply them to a fundamental problem: how does adding together individual preferences make democracy possible? Topics will include redistricting, voting procedures, and election prediction models. We will look at contemporary examples such as the recent New York City mayoral primary election, and the effect of using districts in choosing the Seattle City Council. You will develop arguments, apply data visualization tools and consider the relevance of statistical reasoning and causal inference.

This section will teach quantitative reasoning and numeracy skills using applications related to elections. Currently, scholars employ a wide variety of quantitative approaches when trying to understand problems of social choice and democratic outcomes. Topics and data examined in this section include those related to campaign finance, redistricting, voting algorithms, voter turnout, polling,  and election fraud analysis.  You will learn the production and interpretation of data visualizations, statistics, and how to design research for causal inference.  You will also gain basic proficiency with Microsoft Excel and RStudio. 

This class discusses political topics but it is not part of the college's political science curriculum. It might leverage your interest in political topics but doesn't require any political knowledge, at all.  We will use politics to demonstrate the power of quantitative reasoning.  
 
## Learning Objectives 

At the conclusion of this course, you will be able to:

* Examine ideas, arguments, biases, and assumptions coming from a variety of perspectives, including your own, with an open yet critical mind. 
* Analyze texts and/or quantitative information, recognizing, describing, and questioning patterns, trends, anomalies, and relationships. 
* Present clear, compelling, and effective arguments and/or analysis, supported by evidence. 
* Critically assess numbers and quantitative data as they are employed by political scientists, pundits, and the media for understanding and predicting political phenomena. 
* Relate issues of diversity, equity, and inclusion to how data is gathered, interpreted, and emphasized. 

### Course Website
https://classroom.google.com/c/Mzc2MjMzMzQ1ODU0?cjc=qdrgoor  
This website will be used for both sections. Google Classroom is one of two sites you will use to submit assignments; the other is My Open Math.  Google Classroom will direct you to the right source for readings and submissions.  This site will also contain all documents and links related to the course.

## Course Administration

### Course Portals

In this course you will access four different portals that require your LC id and password for initial contact.  Google Classroom will direct you from session to session, but you will directed to these sites at different phases of the course.

**My Open Math**  
Readings, videos, and quizzes will be available from My Open Math.  Sign up using the link below.  All material will be directly linked from our class website, so you do not need to regularly check this site directly. 
https://www.myopenmath.com/forms.php?action=enroll
The course ID: 118940
The enrollment key: core121

**Google Classroom**  
In addition to serving as the class website, you will submit papers and your excel labs through Google Classroom. Enroll using this link:
https://classroom.google.com/c/Mzc2MjMzMzQ1ODU0?cjc=qdrgoor

**RStudio**  
You can access RStudio using a web browser and signing in to the college's server at https://datasci.watzek.cloud/.  

In your lab assignments, you will explore datasets, generate data visualizations, and perform simple calculations using the RStudio platform, based on the R programming language.  Dozens of videos and online documents can provide a background explanation of R, and a good place to start is the online manual R for Data Science at https://r4ds.had.co.nz/introduction.html.  

**R Programming for Beginners**
I will introduce you to the R programming language using the RStudio platform.  The goal isn't to achieve mastery of R syntax but rather show you the basic workflow and help you recognize situation's when R's power in data management and visualization will help you.  If you want to dive into R, I recommend the R Programming 101 video series in YouTube.  It's entertaining and gentle.

We will have four labs in which you will copy and execute R code in RStudio and report the results. You will also observe the results of changing the code slightly.  For ambitous data visualization projects, you may discover that R can satisfy your requirements better than Excel with a reasonable learning curve.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRtp7wSEtJA&list=PLtL57Fdbwb_AWmWWrFV_pLqq2uicpUIO9

**Microsoft Excel**    
You will also use Microsoft Excel, an ordinary spreadsheet tool, in labs.  You will gain exposure to spreadsheets, and when you compare the experience to RStudio, you'll see how a scripted programming language has particular advantages and problems compared to spreadsheet applications.

For this purpose, Microsoft Excel is preferred over Google Sheets or other open-source alternatives. Lewis & Clark has a Campus Agreement for Microsoft Office. Because of this, current students, staff and faculty can use their @lclark.edu email address to activate a free Office 365 account, which allows them to use Microsoft apps such as Excel. This program is 100% managed by Microsoft and is completely separate from Lewis & Clark College. 

To set up Office 365:

* Go to https://products.office.com/en-us/student/office-in-education to sign up.
* Enter your Lewis & Clark email address
* Click the Get Started button
* Access the link that is sent to your email to complete the registration
* Follow the prompts to activate Office 365 and create your Microsoft account
* Install Office and sign-in with your newly created Office 365 ID

### Lab Groups  
You will regularly work on labs in groups of 3-4.  

Please fill out this short survey to help me select your Excel and RStudio mates:  https://bit.ly/3iX0tmx

### Attendance

Your attendance is expected every class session.  If you can't attend class, please notify me. 

### Laptops and Phones

If you have access to a laptop computer, you *should* bring it to class routinely.

You can bring phones into the classroom, but please note that we have very limited time together and we need to make it count. We all need to be present and free of distraction. I will count on you to do your part.

### Recording Classes  

Lewis & Clark policy generally forbids recording of classes.  The policy states: "...the secret recording (audio or video) of classes, meetings or other conversations, including telephone calls, is prohibited, as not compatible with the law or the promotion of an open exchange of ideas." See me if you have questions.  The policy is available at https://www.lclark.edu/live/profiles/3606-recording-policy.


### Rescheduling Exams  

Notice that the midterm and final exam are scheduled on days that precede college holidays. The exams will take place on those days, and cannot be rescheduled.

### Tutoring at the SQRC  
The Symbolic and Quantitative Resource Center (SQRC) is an informal and free drop-in peer tutoring center. The SQRC will offer both in-person and remote tutoring this semester. In-person tutoring will take place in JR Howard 134 and remote tutoring will take place on the SQRC Discord server. Use this link to join the Discord server: https://discord.gg/VWfT99b

### Changing Sections or Withdrawing  
Any requests to change your Words or Numbers section should be directed to the General Education Office, GenEd@lclark.edu). Because it is a required course designed for first year students, withdrawal is not permitted (unless you are withdrawing from all courses for the semester).

### Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion  
Lewis & Clark and its faculty are committed to diversity, equity, and inclusion in the classroom. I will work hard to ensure that all backgrounds and perspectives thrive in this course.

I am committed to the goal that anyone can achieve mastery of basic quantitative reasoning and the ideas presented in this course. Typecasting ourselves as a "math" or "non-math" person is self-limiting and needless.

If your learning needs are not being met, or you do not feel comfortable with the material being discussed, I am counting on you to let me know.  I will do my best to support a classroom climate that supports a diversity of thoughts, perspectives, and experiences, and that honors your identities (including race, gender, class, religion, ability, etc.). Matters of identity and American politics are inextricably intertwined and as such will be regularly discussed in class and will likely require consideration in your research projects.

### Activities and Grading Formula

The work in this class includes the following:

* Reading ahead of classroom attendance and participation
* Reading, videos, and exercises using the My Open Math platform
* Labs and lab submissions using Microsoft Excel and RStudio
* One 6-8 page paper
* Two group projects

**Two exams: 20% each**\
Each exam is independent and not cumulative (Learning Objectives #2 and #4).  The midterm will take place during the regular class period for Wednesday October 6.  The final exam as scheduled by the university: https://college.lclark.edu/offices/registrar/final_exam_schedule/fall/  

The section 1 final exam takes place on Tuesday, December 14 from 1-4pm in JR Howard 115.
The section 11 final exam takes place on Saturday, December 11 from 1-4pm in JR Howard 253. 

**Research paper & presentation: 20%**  
You are responsible for one 6-8 page paper on a topic related to elections or public opinion that marshals data to provide evidence and includes an original data visualization. In addition, you will present your argument and analysis to the class and answer questions from your colleagues about your analysis. As part of this project, you will need to address how your data and analysis reflects on issues of inclusion, diversity, and equity. (Learning Objectives #2, #3, #4, and #5).

Note that there will be a data visualization contest sponsored by the library, and you're invited to submit your work for that competition. The library will publish details later in the semester.

**Homework/labs: 20%**  
The class will be structured to be participatory, particularly using small groups. This requires everyone to have done the readings and come prepared adequately to critically engage with a variety of arguments, approaches, and data. I will assign periodic activities that will build data literacy, including quizzes, homework, or other assignments. Students will be expected to complete a series of excel-based learning labs, with time devoted to this activity in class. (Learning Objectives #1, #2, #3, #4, and #5) 

**Attendance/ Participation: 5%**  

**Group Projects: 15%**  
There will be three group projects to submit in this course. The output of each project will vary (presentation, written components) and will be explained at the start of each project. You will be graded based on project quality and by peer review.  Significant class time will be devoted to these projects. 

**Late work submissions**
Unless otherwise specified, late work will be penalized by 2/3 of a grade per day.  This means, for example, that an assignment graded as a B will be dropped to C+ the first late day, and to C- the second day.  Work submitted more than 48 hours late will not be accepted.

### Course Description

We expect democracies to translate public desire into coherent political choices. And we expect elections to deliver these results. But aggregating preferences with elections is harder than it looks. The simplest elections based on innocent design choices will produce paradoxical and confounding results.

In this course, weâ€™ll introduce mathematical and logical tools that can help us understand the paradoxes of elections. You will use these tools to develop and refine your quantitative reasoning skills and apply them to a fundamental problem: how does adding together individual preferences make democracy possible? Topics will include redistricting, voting procedures, and election prediction models. We will look at contemporary examples such as the 2021 New York City mayoral election, and the effect of using districts in choosing the Seattle City Council. You will develop arguments, apply data visualization tools and consider the relevance of statistical reasoning and causal inference.

This section will teach quantitative reasoning and numeracy skills using applications related to elections. Currently, scholars employ a wide variety of quantitative approaches when trying to understand problems of social choice and democratic outcomes. Topics and data examined in this section include those related campaign finance, redistricting, voting algorithms, voter turnout, polling,  and election fraud analysis.  Students will learn the production and interpretation of data visualizations, statistics, and how to design research for causal inference.  They will also gain basic proficiency in the software Microsoft Excel. 

This class discusses political topics but it is not part of the college's political science curriculum. It might leverage your interest in political topics but doesn't require any political knowledge, at all.  We are just going to use politics as the basis for applying quantitative reasoning.  

### Learning Objectives: 

* Examine ideas, arguments, biases, and assumptions coming from a variety of perspectives, including their own, with an open yet critical mind. 
* Analyze texts and/or quantitative information, recognizing, describing, and questioning patterns, trends, anomalies, and relationships. 
* Present clear, compelling, and effective arguments and/or analysis, supported by evidence. 
* Critically assess numbers and quantitative data as they are employed by political scientists, pundits, and the media for understanding and predicting political phenomena. 
* Relate issues of diversity, equity, and inclusion to how data is gathered, interpreted, and emphasized. 

### Course Website
https://classroom.google.com/c/Mzc2MjMzMzQ1ODU0?cjc=qdrgoor  
This website will be used for both sections.  Google Classroom is one of two sites you will use to submit assignments.  This site will also house documents and links related to the course.

## Course Administration

### Additional Course Portals

**My Open Math**  
Readings, videos, and quizzes will be available from My Open Math.  Sign up using the link below.  All material will be directly linked from our class website, so you do not need to regularly check this site directly. 
https://www.myopenmath.com/forms.php?action=enroll
The course ID: 118940
The enrollment key: core121

**Google Classroom**  
You will submit papers and your excel labs through links directed to google classroom.  You do not need to check this site directly. 
Enroll using this link:
https://classroom.google.com/c/Mzc2MjMzMzQ1ODU0?cjc=qdrgoor

**RStudio**  
In your lab assignments, you will explore datasets, generate data visualizations, and perform simple calculations using the RStudio platform, based on the R programming language.  Dozens of videos and online documents can provide a background explanation of R, and a good place to start is the online manual R for Data Science at https://r4ds.had.co.nz/introduction.html.  

You can access RStudio using a web browser and signing in to the college's server at https://datasci.watzek.cloud/.  

**Microsoft Excel**    
You will also use an ordinary spreadsheet tool in labs.  In this way, you'll see how a scripted programming language has advantages over spredsheet applications, despite the popularity of spreadsheets.  

For this purpose, Microsoft Excel is preferred over Google Sheets or other open-source alternatives. Lewis & Clark has a Campus Agreement for Microsoft Office. Because of this, current students, staff and faculty can use their @lclark.edu email address to activate a free Office 365 account, which allows them to use Microsoft apps such as Excel. This program is 100% managed by Microsoft and is completely separate from Lewis & Clark College. 

To set up Office 365:

* Go to https://products.office.com/en-us/student/office-in-education to sign up.
* Enter your Lewis & Clark email address
* Click the Get Started button
* Access the link that is sent to your email to complete the registration
* Follow the prompts to activate Office 365 and create your Microsoft account
* Install Office and sign-in with your newly created Office 365 ID

### Lab Groups  
You will regularly work on labs in groups of 3-4.  Please fill out this short survey to help me select your Excel and RStudio mates: https://forms.gle/gyR8t4Pp5HLyeFD99

### Abscences around holidays  
Notice that the midterm and final exam are scheduled on days that precede college holidays. The exams will take place on those days, and cannot be rescheduled.

### Tutoring at the SQRC  
The Symbolic and Quantitative Resource Center (SQRC) is an informal and free drop-in peer tutoring center. The SQRC will offer both in-person and remote tutoring this semester. In-person tutoring will take place in JR Howard 134 and remote tutoring will take place on the SQRC Discord server. Use this link to join the Discord server: https://discord.gg/VWfT99b

### Changing Sections or Withdrawing  
Any requests to change your Words or Numbers section should be directed to the General Education Office, GenEd@lclark.edu). Because it is a required course designed for first year students, withdrawal is not permitted (unless you are withdrawing from all courses for the semester).

### Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion  
Lewis & Clark and its faculty are committed to diversity, equity, and inclusion in the classroom. I will work very hard to ensure that all backgrounds and perspectives thrive in this course. I am committed to the belief anyone can achieve mastery of basic quantiative reasoning, and that typecasting ourselves as a "math" or "non-math" person is self-limiting and unnecessary. If your learning needs are not being met, or you do not feel comfortable with the material being discussed, I am counting on you to let me know.  I will do my best to support a classroom climate that supports a diversity of thoughts, perspectives, and experiences, and that honors your identities (including race, gender, class, sexuality, religion, ability, etc.). Matters of identity and American politics are inextricably intertwined and as such will be regularly discussed in class and will require consideration in your research projects.

### Activities and Grading Formula

The work in this class includes the following:

* Reading ahead of classroom attendance and participation
* Reading, videos, and exercises using the My Open Math platform.
* Labs and lab submissions using Microsoft Excel and RStudio.
* One 6-8 page paper.
* Two group projects

**Two exams: 20% each**
Each exam is independent and not cumulative (Learning Objectives #2 and #4).  The midterm will be taking during class and the Final exam as scheduled by the university: https://college.lclark.edu/offices/registrar/final_exam_schedule/fall/  Our class is scheduled for a final exam on Tuesday, December 14 from 1-4pm in the usual classroom.

**Research paper & presentation: 20%**  
You are responsible for one 6-8 page paper on a topic related to elections or public opinion that marshals data to provide evidence and includes an original data visualization. In addition, you will present your argument and analysis to the class and answer questions from your colleagues about your analysis. As part of this project, you will need to address how your data and analysis reflects on issues of inclusion, diversity, and equity. (Learning Objectives #2, #3, #4, and #5) 

**Homework/labs: 20%**  
The class will be structured to be participatory, particularly using small groups. This requires everyone to have done the readings and prepared adequately to critically engage with a variety of arguments, approaches, and data. I will assign periodic activities that will build data literacy, including quizzes, homework, or other assignments. Students will be expected to complete a series of excel-based learning labs, with time devoted to this activity in class. (Learning Objectives #1, #2, #3, #4, and #5) 

**Attendance/ Participation: 5%**  

**Group Projects: 15%**  
There will be three group projects to submit in this course. The output of each project will vary (presentation, written components) and will be explained at the start of each project. You will be graded based on project quality and by peer review.  Significant class time will be devoted to these projects. 

**Late work submissions**
Unless otherwise specified, late work will be penalized by 2/3 of a grade per day.  This means, for example, that an assignment graded as a B will be dropped to C+ the first late day, and to C- the second day.  Work submitted more than 48 hours late will not be accepted.
